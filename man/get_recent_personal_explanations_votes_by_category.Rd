Lawmakers, mostly in the House but also in the Senate, can make personal explanations for missed or mistaken votes in the Congressional Record. Unlike the “Recent Personal Explanations” response, this response contains explanations parsed to individual votes and have an additional category attribute describing the general reason for the absence or incorrect vote.
