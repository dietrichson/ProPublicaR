#' Get a Specific Bil
#' 
#' Use this request type to get details on bills that may be considered by the House or Senate in the near future,
#' based on scheduled published or announced by congressional leadership.
#'
#' The responses include a legislative_day attribute which is the earliest the bills could be considered,
#' and a range attribute that indicates whether the bill information comes from a weekly schedule or a daily one.
#' Combine the two for the best sense of when a bill might come up for consideration. For Senate bills,
#' the response includes a context attribute reproducing the sentence that includes mention of the bill.
#' These responses omit bills that have not yet been assigned a bill number or introduced, and additional bills
#' may be considered at any time.
#'
#' @param bill_id a bill slug, for example hr4881 - these can be found in the recent bill response.
#' @param congress 105-116
#' @inheritParams get_new_members
#' 
#' @return List with the result of the query
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' \donttest{
#' get_a_bill(115, 'hr21')
#' }
