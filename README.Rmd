## Purpose
This package provides wrapper functions to access the ProPublica's Congress and Campaign Finance APIs. The Congress API provides near real-time access to legislative data from the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Library of Congress. The Campaign Finance API provides data from United States Federal Election Commission  filings and other sources. The API covers summary information for candidates and committees, as well as certain types of itemized data.

For more information about these APIs go to: <https://www.propublica.org/datastore/apis>
